                        Myths and legends are an integral part of human existence. They have been around us all the
                        time. Though their validity is susceptible, nobody seems to mind as they stand as a proof of the
                        human belief in divine powers. Here we bring to you a collection of popular mythological stories
                        that will take you to times of yore when gods co-habited with humans, divine voices could be
                        heard and visions seen. Know more about deities you worship every day. Indian mythology contains
                        a vast array of ancient tales that are exciting, entertaining, and packed with moral lessons.
                        Know about the extraordinary sacrifices made and great feats achieved.

                        <br><br>
                        The recent findings suggest that most of these stories are not mythology, but are actually
                        ancient Indian and Hindu civilization history. For example, all the places mentioned in Ramayana
                        and Mahabharata exist in perfect order, and many carry artifacts from that period, as described
                        in the epics. Lord Krishna's city, Dwarka, which the epic Mahabharata said was submerged in the
                        seas, is of much interest these days, as ruins of the same have been found underwater. This page
                        is a collection of the most important and interesting <b>Hindu Mythology Stories</b>.

            <h2>Stories of Shri Krishna</h2>

            <p>
            <div class="krishna">
                <div class="p">
                    Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu, is a revered figure in Hindu mythology. His story is
                    rich with divine miracles and teachings that continue to inspire millions of people worldwide. Here
                    is a
                    brief summary of Lord Krishna's story:
                    <br><br>
                    Krishna was born in Mathura to King Vasudeva and Queen Devaki. However, fearing the prophecy that
                    Devaki's eighth child would be his downfall, King Kamsa, Devaki's brother, imprisoned them and
                    killed
                    their children. Krishna's father secretly transported him to the village of Gokul, where he was
                    raised
                    by his foster parents, Nanda and Yashoda.
                   
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="image/krishna1.gif" alt="krishna1">
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="p">
                <br>
                In Gokul, Krishna grew up as a mischievous and playful child. He displayed divine powers, such as
                lifting the Govardhan Hill on his little finger to protect the villagers from torrential rains and
                defeating demons sent by Kamsa to kill him.
                <br><br>
                As he grew older, Krishna became known for his enchanting flute playing, which mesmerized both humans
                and animals alike. He also became renowned for his romantic escapades, particularly with the cowherd
                girls (Gopis), especially Radha. Their love symbolized the divine union of the soul with God.
                <br><br>
                Krishna played a vital role in the epic battle of Kurukshetra in the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. He served
                as the charioteer and counselor to Arjuna, one of the Pandava princes. During the battle, Krishna
                imparted profound wisdom through the Bhagavad Gita, a spiritual discourse that emphasized duty,
                righteousness, and the pursuit of self-realization.
                <br><br>
                Krishna's teachings emphasized the importance of devotion (bhakti) and love for God. He preached that
                true happiness lies in surrendering oneself to the divine and performing one's duties without attachment
                to the results.
                <br><br>
                Eventually, Krishna's earthly life came to an end when he was accidentally struck by an arrow. He left
                behind a legacy of spiritual enlightenment and eternal love. Lord Krishna's teachings continue to guide
                people on the path of righteousness and devotion to this day, making him an immortal figure in Hindu
                mythology.
