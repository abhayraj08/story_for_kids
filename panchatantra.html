                Once upon a time, in a jungle there lived a jackal by the name of Gomaya. One day, he was very hungry
                and was wandering in search of food. While wandering, he came across a battle field. There he saw a big
                drum lying under a tree. When the wind blew, a tender branch grown at the root of the tree struck the
                drum producing sound of a drum beat. The jackal examined the drum from all sides and then beat the drum
                with his front paws. The drum made a sound. Now the jackal thought that there might be some other small
                animal inside the drum and that would make a very tasty meal for him. But he found the top of the drum
                too tough to tear off.
                <br><br>
                The jackal thought of a plan and began to beat the drum with both his front paws.The sound of drumbeat
                filled the whole jungle. A leopard who was attracted towards the sound of the drum, came near it. The
                jackal said to the leopard, "Your Majesty, there is some animal hiding inside the drum. Since you have
                sharp claws and strong teeth, you can tear off the top of the drum and catch your prey inside the drum.
                <br><br>
                The leopard was himself hungry So he hit the top of the drum with his heavy paws. The drum burst with a
                sound, but there was no animal inside. The drum was empty.
                <br><br>
                Seeing the empty drum, the leopard became very angry and said to the jackal, "You have wasted my time.
                There is no food inside the drum. So I will kill and eat you."
                <br><br>
                The leopard pounced upon the jackal and killed and ate him.

            <h2>2. THE FOUR FRIENDS AND THE HUNTER</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                <center>
                    <img src="image/four-friends-and-the-hunter.jpg" alt="">
                </center><br>
                Long, long ago, there lived three friends in a jungle. They were-a deer, a crow and a mouse. They used
                to share their meals together.
                <br><br>
                One day, a turtle came to them and said, "I also want to join your company and become your friend. I'm
                all alone. "
                <br><br>
                "You're most welcome," said the crow. "But what about your personal safety. There are many hunters
                around. They visit this jungle regularly. Suppose, a hunter comes, how will you save yourself?"
                <br><br>
                "That is the reason why I want to join your group," said the turtle
                <br><br>
                No sooner had they talked about it than a hunter appeared on the scene. Seeing the hunter, the deer
                darted away; the crow flew in the sky and the mouse ran into a hole. The turtle tried to crawl away
                fast, but he was caught by the hunter. The hunter tied him up in the net. He was sad to lose the deer.
                But he thought, it was better to feast on the turtle rather than to go hungry.
                <br><br>
                The turtle's three friends became much worried to see his friend trapped by the hunter. They sat
                together to think of some plan to free his friend from the hunter's snare.
                <br><br>
                The crow then flew high up in the sky and spotted the hunter walking along the river bank. As per the
                plan the deer ran ahead of the hunter unnoticed and lay on the hunter's path as if dead.
                <br><br>
                The hunter saw the deer from a distance, lying on the ground. He was very happy to have found it again.
                "Now I'll have a good feast on it and sell its beautiful skin in the market," thought the hunter to
                himself. He put down the turtle on to the ground and ran to pick up the deer.
                <br><br>
                In the meantime, as planned, the rat gnawed through the net and freed the turtle. The turtle hurriedly
                crawled away into the river water.
                <br><br>
                Unaware of the plot of these friends, the hunter went to fetch the dear for its tasty flesh and
                beautiful skin. But, what he saw with his mouth agape was that, when he reached near, the deer suddenly
                sprang up to its feet and darted away in the jungle. Before he could understand anything, the deer had
                disappeared.
                <br><br>
                Dejected, the hunter turned back to collect the turtle he had left behind on the ground in the snare.
                But he was shocked to see the snare lying nibbled at and the turtle missing. For a moment, the hunter
                thought that he was dreaming. But the damaged snare lying on the ground was proof enough to confirm that
                he was very much awake and he was compelled to believe that some miracle had taken place.
                <br><br>
                The hunter got frightened on account of these happenings and ran out of the jungle.
                <br><br>
                The four friends once again started living happily.
